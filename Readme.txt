Using Zooper Widget Pro templates for common information widgets saves RAM.  Zooper Widget Pro has one reasonably sized footprint for multiple widgets. My designs include: available RAM, WiFi status, Battery Status and time and temperature.  I developed these for my Nook HD+, which has only 782 MB in usable RAM.  To function, these widgets require you download Zooper Widget Pro from the Google Play Store for $2.99.
